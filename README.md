# Say Hi to Marvin

Marvin is Slack bot written in Go that allows Slack users to use Slash Commands to fetch a list of Github Issues that match a specific criteria.  We use a service called Waffle (http://waffle.io) that allows us to view our Issues in a kanban style board.  Each lane on Waffle has a corresponding label within Github issues.  We use these labels to keep track of which stage each issue is in across our entire company.

Example:

type `/backlog RepoName` into Slack and it will display the current backlog items for that project.

or `/readyforqa RepoName` and youâ€™ll see all the items currently in progress.

`/assigned * GithubName` will fetch all tasks assigned to that user under the specified organization.
or
```/assigned RepoName GitHub```  Will fetch all tasks assigned to that user under that repo.

# Running Locally

Setup your go environment and make sure you have the `$GOPATH` variable defined as well as include `$GOPATH/bin` in your `$PATH`.

Pull down the latest source code from Github for Marvin and after you should be able to see the files under `$GOPATH/src` directory

```
go get github.com/RobotsAndPencils/marvin
```

Create the `config.json` and `github.json` files and put your specific slack and github information into it. Save these files in the `$GOPATH/src/github.com/RobotsAndPencils/marvin` directory.

## config.json

```
{ 
        "domain": "YOUR SLACK DOMAIN HERE", 
        "port": 4444, 
        "webhookpath": "RNP SLACK WEBHOOKPATH HERE"
}
```

**domain** is the subdomain of the slack url used by your company. For example it would be the `mycompany` part of `mycompany.slack.com`

**webhookpath** This will need to be set up in Slack's incoming webhooks integration. If the integration has already been set up you can find the value in Slack settings: `Integrations > Configured Integrations > Incoming WebHooks > #channel > Webhook URL`. Where `#channel` is the slack channel that the webhook is set up to post to.

## github.json

```
{ 
        "owner": "YOUR GITHUB ID HERE",
        "personalAccessToken": "YOUR GITHUB ACCESS TOKEN HERE" 
}
```

**owner** is the userid or organization id that you want to use that has access to all of the repos you want the bot to be able to query.

**personalAccessToken** can be found by going to `settings/profile` on github.com and selecting `Generate New Token` from the `Personal Access Token` tab.

Then, you can run/test the programs locally after initializing 

```
make init
make run
make test
```

To test, use a web posting tool like `Postman` to sent a POST to `http://localhost:4444/slack` with `x-www-form-urlencoded` with at least a `command` and `text` parameters. For example:

```
command /assigned
text myrepository somelogin
```

This should, by default, output information in the default channel you set up when you created the Incoming Webhook.

# Deploying to Heroku

The app can be easily deployed to Heroku, but you need to set up a few config variables to make it work. First, you need to set `BUILDPACK_URL` to be 

```
https://github.com/kr/heroku-buildpack-go.git
```

Then, set `GITHUB_CONFIG` variable to the following JSON with your variables replaced:

```
{ 
	"owner": "YOUR ORG NAME", 
  	"personalAccessToken" : "PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN WITH ACCESS TO ALL REPOS OF ORG" 
}
```
Your Org Name should be substituted by your organization name, that you want to be able to run the queries for.

The personal access token should be from a user with read access to all of the repos in your org. Don't give it too much power. Create one of these in your `Personal Settings > Applications > Personal Access Tokens` section of your GitHub settings.

Then, you need to set `MARVIN_CONFIG` to json like the following:

```
{
	"domain": "SLACK DOMAIN - EVERYTHING BEFORE .slack.com", 
	"webhookpath" : "INCOMING WEBHOOK PATH AFTER /services/"
}
```

The webhook path is everything after the /services/ in an incoming webhook that you've created. It'll look like three randomized strings of characters with slashes between.

Make sure you also update your GoDeps. `godep save`, then commit the changes to your git repo.

# Setting up your Slack

You need to create a bunch of Slack Slash commands, each pointing at the same URL with the following command names and parameters:

```
/backlog [repo]
/sprint [repo]
/inprogress [repo]
/readyforqa [repo]
/qapass [repo]
/assigned [repo|*] [login]
```

The URL you need to configure will be `https://herokudomain.herokuapp.com/slack`.

Also, you need to create an Incoming Webhook integration and use the end part of the webhook path for parts of the configuration above.

# Acknowledgements

This code is heavily influenced by: `https://github.com/trinchan/slackbot` with only slight divergences. The incoming webhook was changed to a post, and the configuration can come from either the environment or files on disk.
